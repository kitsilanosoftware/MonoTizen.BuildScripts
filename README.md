# MonoTizen Build Scripts

Shared build scripts for Mono in Tizen environments

## Licenses

Currently "all rights reserved"; the licensing terms (MIT?) are to be
decided by Bob Summerwill and Damien Diederen <dd@crosstwine.com>.

## Usage

    `./build-mono.sh [--autogen|--configure] [--build] [--install]`

The correct configuration and build options that are passed down to
the Mono build scripts depend on the build host.  Have a look at the
script for details; questions to Damien Diederen <dd@crosstwine.com>.
